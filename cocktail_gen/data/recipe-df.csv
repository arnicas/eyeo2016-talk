"/recipes/1017847-deathbed-manhattan","Deathbed Manhattan","Robert Simonson","Allen Katz, founder of the New York Distilling Company in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, spent years worrying over his first rye whiskey, tasting and testing it until it was ripe for bottling. So it only makes sense that he would fuss over the manhattan recipe that uses his new Ragtime Rye. After some tests, he settled on splitting the vermouth component between two products: the bolder, fruitier Martini & Rossi sweet vermouth and the more complex, dry, herbaceous Punt e Mes. Otherwise, it’s a straightforward version of this classic cocktail, which traditionally called for rye. And it lives up to its name: It’s so good, you may request it as your final drink.","Combine all the liquid ingredients in a mixing glass three-quarters filled with ice, and stir until chilled, about 30 seconds.

You can’t get more seasonal than that.  ","Combine the bourbon, Chartreuse and simple syrup in a mixing glass over ice. Stir, then strain into a double old-fashioned glass over a large ice cube.

Here, Columbus, Ohio, bartender Travis Owens uses a full third of an ounce. The liqueur is prevented from taking over the drink by the assertiveness of the two Scotches and the strong, herbal quality of the Punt e Mes. This is a rich, potent nightcap that lies somewhere between a Rob Roy and a Boulevardier.","Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass three-quarters filled with ice.

This was his response. The big, sweet menthol hit of the amaro Branca Menta — while marrying wonderfully with the herbal tequila and bitter Suze — also provides the illusion of coolness in a drink that has none.","In a rocks glass, combine all ingredients.

As with many of the bulldog variations created by Eben Freeman at Genuine Liquorette, a bar in Little Italy, the booze comes from a 50-milliliter mini-bottle and the mixer from the short can the bottle is emptied into. Don’t expect a lot of finesse from this drink; it is a highball, after all. But expect a little more fun than usual. If you can’t find a mini of Jim Beam, another light whiskey like Jameson will do.","Open the can of ginger ale and use a citrus reamer to widen the hole.

"/recipes/1017512-pineapple-express","Pineapple Express","Robert Simonson","With its understated, background fruit notes, Plantation Pineapple Rum Stiggins’ Fancy can easily be used in a wide variety of classic cocktail recipes without upsetting the drink’s balance. It makes a good old-fashioned, rum sour or El Presidente. The Pineapple Express, created by Freddie Sarkis of the Broken Shaker in Chicago, is simply a daiquiri with a split of pineapple rum and rhum agricole doing the work usually done by a white rum. The combination adds more richness and character to the drink, though you may not notice the pineapple until the second or third sip. That’s a testimony to the subtlety of the cocktail.","Combine the pineapple rum, rhum agricole, lime juice and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker three-quarters filled with ice. Shake vigorously for about 30 seconds. Strain into chilled coupe glass. Squeeze grapefruit twist over drink and discard.

Let melon macerate overnight, or for a few hours, in refrigerator. Scoop out 2 heaping tablespoons of the watermelon and add to a cocktail shaker 3/4 filled with ice. Be sure to get some liquid as well as chunks of fruit. Add the remaining ounce of tequila, the lime juice and the simple syrup. Shake vigorously so the melon chunks break up into slush and the drink chills, about 30 seconds. Pour into a 10-ounce rocks glass. Add more ice if needed.

Bitter Coffee, a hot, creamy concoction suited to the winter holidays, takes as its base Cynar, the bittersweet Italian liqueur that incorporates flavors of artichoke and rhubarb, among others. A few minutes of easy whisking over a stove yields a full-flavored mugful in which the maple-vanilla roundness of the drink are snapped to attention by the edgy amaro and steaming coffee.","Fill a small saucepan halfway with water. Over medium heat, bring to a gentle boil. In a heat-safe bowl about the same diameter as the saucepan, whisk together the Cynar, rum, maple syrup, egg yolk and vanilla. Place bowl on top of the saucepan, as water continues boiling, and whisk mixture for about another 2 to 3 minutes, just long enough to warm it and thicken it slightly.

The cocktail is basically a whiskey sour armed with two secret weapons: the distinctly sweet-tart flavor of Honeycrisp apple juice and Amaro Abano, which the bartender called a “spice bomb, adding cinnamon and clove notes while adding a pleasant bitterness.” It is suited for the cocktail hour, or just before dinner.","Make Demerara syrup: In a small saucepan, mix the sugar with 1 cup water.

For bartenders and barflies, this deliciously complex mix of Campari, gin and sweet vermouth has become an easy way to fly one’s flag as a knowing cocktail classicist.

Without this refreshing Italian-born highball — Campari, sweet vermouth and club soda — there would have been no blueprint for the gin-loving Count Camillo Negroni to experiment with a century ago. (The drink’s family line actually goes back even farther; the Americano grew out of a simpler aperitif that omitted the soda, called the Milano-Torino — Milano in honor of the birthplace of Campari, Torino for the vermouth.) While the Americano doesn’t have quite the romance that’s grown around the Negroni, it also doesn’t have nearly as much alcohol. It’s a lighter and saner choice for summertime drinking.

"/recipes/1016298-kalimotxo","Kalimotxo","Rosie Schaap","Some might consider the kalimotxo (pronounced cal-ee-MO-cho) a guilty pleasure; I’ve received more than a few skeptical glances when I’ve ordered it at bars in New York. But I don’t feel an iota of contrition when I drink this Basque-country classic. It couldn’t be easier: equal parts red wine (some say the cheaper the better, but that’s up to you) and cola. I like a squeeze of lemon juice for a little brightness, and maybe a slice of lemon or orange to dress it up. But purists might consider even those modest additions a little fussy. The overall effect is surprisingly sangria-esque, minus all that fruit-chopping and waiting, and wonderfully refreshing. If you can find cola made with cane sugar rather than corn syrup, all the better, but the drink is still fine with whatever you’ve got on hand. The soda’s caffeine actually makes the kalimotxo a fine pick-me-up: an ideal afternoon drink when you know you’ve still got a long day, and night, ahead.","In a glass filled with ice, combine 3 or 4 ounces dry red wine (preferably Spanish) with an equal amount of cola and 1 squeeze lemon juice.

Though it is also sweet, its penetrating citrine pop cuts like the Jaws of Life at the close of a hearty meal. It helps to have another pair of hands while setting this up, but once you’ve gotten the initial setup in place, it takes care of itself.","Pour the spirit into the well-cleaned urn. Drape the cheesecloth in crossing swaths, making sure to gauge the length so that once the weight of the lemons is pending, they cannot reach the spirit. Bind the cheesecloth tightly in place on the outside edge of the urn with the butcher’s twine, wrapping it under a lip to make certain it is well held. Place the lemons into their hammock and cap the whole with the lid. If the lid has a plastic or rubber gasket, you may wish to remove it, lest it leach any off-flavors into the mix. Store in a stable environment out of sunlight for nine weeks. Given variables like temperature and humidity, your limoncello may be ready before then. Warmer climates will speed up the process. Avoid opening the jar, as it will set the curing process back, but do pay attention to the color of the mix; you want it rich with a kind of varnished yellow, but it can actually go too far, overextracting into a brown color with an intensity that can be too much for some people’s taste. At the end of the aging period you should have roughly 1 4/10 liters of unsweetened lemon spirit at roughly 60 percent alcohol by volume, or 120 proof. Make a simple syrup of ½ liter water and the same of sugar. When dissolved fully, add to the lemon spirit and mix well. Taste for strength, balance and sweetness and adjust water for dilution and/or sugar if necessary. Be cautious not to drown the lemon’s bite and aromatics with too much sugar, but also bear in mind that if you’re serving your limoncello from the freezer, you will perceive slightly less sweetness in the frozen mixture.","02limoncello-cecchini-videoSixteenByNine310.jpg","fixed-height"

"/recipes/1015308-the-boulevardier","The Boulevardier","Toby Cecchini","It’s puzzling that the Boulevardier cocktail hasn’t found wider fame in the current fast-moving mixology environment, where old and storied is as revered as bitter and brown. Ask most mustached bar wags what their favorite cocktail is and a strong percentage would cite either the Negroni or the Manhattan. No surprise there; these are bedrock classics. Ask those same self-anointed experts to make you a Boulevardier and a strong percentage might be left scratching their heads. The Boulevardier is a marvel of a cocktail with an enviably colorful peerage, and it’s effectively the bastard child of those two other cocktails. In colder months, it’s a magnificent drink to have as a fallback when you want something richer and more complex than just a whiskey but can never seem to think of what else to order. It’s composed of two parts American whiskey, with one part each of sweet vermouth and Campari. Taken one way, it’s a Manhattan with a portion of Campari swapped in for the regular few drops of Angostura or other aromatic bitters. Seen the other way, it’s a Negroni with whiskey in place of the gin.","Stir ingredients together in a mixing glass filled with ice, strain into either a stemmed cocktail glass or a rocks glass with ice, to preference.

The more accepted versions are granted to Victor J. Bergeron, the irascible, wooden-legged “Trader Vic,” from his eponymous restaurant bar in Oakland, Calif., in the ’40s. Contrary to what you might think, the mai tai is actually just a rum sour, employing orgeat alongside Curaçao or triple sec as the sweetener, and using two rums to add complexity. The rest is just lime juice, and that’s it. No coconut, no passion fruit, pineapple, mango or orange juice. No umbrellas. It’s a relatively simple drink, but as such, each element has to be of the utmost quality; great rums, fresh lime juice and prefab orgeat syrup equal disappointment.

"/recipes/1015320-dark-n-stormy","Dark ’n’ Stormy","Toby Cecchini","The dark ’n’ stormy has become a cult highball due to a felicitous combination of its no-fault simplicity and the balance of its exotic, headstrong ingredients, each of which is perfectly suited to the common goal: reviving the flagging, heat-pummeled constitution. It is simply dark rum — very dark rum — with ginger beer and some fresh lime. The rich spirit is shaken awake by the buoyant piquancy of the ginger beer, while the lime slashes through the sweetness of both. The drink has its roots in Bermuda, and emigrated up the Atlantic seaboard with the sailing set. Gosling’s rum has a rather sniffy and debatable lock on the recipe, having in fact trademarked its version, even going to the point of threatening with the specter of litigation anyone who might suggest concocting one with another rum. Gosling’s is a delicious rum, and being the dark rum from Bermuda, it is unquestionably synonymous with the dark ‘n’ stormy. But, any number of dark rums are interchangeably lovely in this drink, including Coruba, Zaya, Cruzan’s Blackstrap and the Lemon Hart 151 from Guyana.","Build the drink in a highball glass filled with ice, adjusting for sweetness and tartness.

While other sours, such as the daiquiri, the Daisy, the Sidecar and select others, are revered and reinterpreted in their dotage, this mainstay of the 1920s and ’30s has fallen so far out of circulation that few still know its name. More’s the pity, for when properly made it is one of the canon’s stronger pillars, and a perfect sip when the post-equinox winds set in. The drink is simply a sour made from apple brandy — or applejack, as it was known from Colonial times through Prohibition — with grenadine syrup as the sweetener. Its name is attributed to any number of colorful characters, including a famous gangster stool pigeon, but it most likely comes from the shortening of applejack and the dusty rose color the drink attains from the grenadine and citrus.","Shake over ice and strain into a stemmed cocktail glass.

"/recipes/10365-van-cortlandt-punch","Van Cortlandt Punch","Suzanne M. Charle","Here’s a bit of New York City history for you: This punch was originally served in 1710 at the inauguration of Jacobus Van Cortlandt, one of the last old Dutch politicians and the city’s 30th mayor (he returned to office in 1719 as the city’s 33rd.) The recipe was brought back to light by Richard Ferrugio, who catered the inaugural of Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1986. Mayor Van Cortlandt's swearing-in, Walt Whitman wrote, was a full-day affair “much in keeping with the celebrations of the Old Netherlands.” He added: “Very popular were all the hot punches, seasoned and tempted with brandy.” This is the perfect libation for a winter inaugural party, when you can watch a ceremony that lends a little class to the blood sport of politics.","Place the cinnamon sticks, cloves and cardamom pods in a cheesecloth bag and tie securely.
