# eyeo2016-talk

These are the slides and toys I built for my talk at Eyeo 2016 (and before that, [Alt-ai](http://alt-ai.net) in NYC).  The talks is about poetry, generated text, AI, bots, twitter, and tools for creativity.

You might want to look at these through [arnicas.github.io](https://arnicas.github.io/eyeo2016-talk/) for the project links to work.

**Toy Links**:

* [Rhyme-Finder](rhyme-finder)
* **NeuralNet UK Map** -- the code is [here](https://github.com/arnicas/eyeo2016-talk/tree/gh-pages/uk_nnet_map) but I can't get it to run on a server (timing issue with a giant db file that I'm working on).
* [Via 2.0 - Neural Net versions of Dante's Inferno start](Dante)
* [Genetic Algorithm Castle-Poetry Generator](genetic_castles)
