# eyeo2016-talk

These are the slides and toys I built for my talk at Eyeo 2016.

Links:

* [Rhyme-Finder](rhyme-finder)
* Neural Net UK Map -- the code is [here](https://github.com/arnicas/eyeo2016-talk/tree/gh-pages/uk_nnet_map) but I can't get it to run on a server (timing issue with a giant db file).
* [Via 2.0 - Neural Net versions of Dante's Inferno start](Dante)
* [Genetic Algorithm Castle-Poetry Generator](genetic_castles)
* [Cocktail Remixes](cocktail_gen)
